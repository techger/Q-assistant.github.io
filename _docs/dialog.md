The Dialog service is the service an input device communicates with.  
Text or Audio input will be sent to [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/){: target="_blank" } which returns an [Intent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/intents-overview){: target="_blank" }, this in turn will be matched with a skill, and if a matching skill is found it will be triggered.
